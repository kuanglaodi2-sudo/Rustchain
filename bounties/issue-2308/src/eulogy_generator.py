Eulogy Generator — Poetic hardware obituaries for retired miners.

Generates meaningful eulogy text incorporating actual miner statistics
like attestation count, RTC earned, architecture, and years of service.

Supports multiple eulogy styles:
- Poetic: Lyrical and emotional
- Technical: Focus on specs and achievements
- Humorous: Light-hearted send-off
- Epic: Grand heroic narrative
